# CNN Flowers Classification

This project involves the training and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying different types of flowers.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust CNN model that can accurately classify flowers into various categories. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of flowers, and it leverages deep learning techniques to learn and recognize patterns within the images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of a collection of flower images. It is important to ensure that the dataset is properly organized with labeled classes.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture is designed to extract hierarchical features from the input images. It typically includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained using a labeled dataset to learn the relationships between image features and flower classes.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other necessary libraries

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
